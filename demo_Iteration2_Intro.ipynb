Remember that data very rarely comes to us in a form that is optimized for analysis. We usually have to start with “raw” data and work it into a clean, or “tidy” dataset.\n\nIn the discussion below, we refer to each row of data we have as an observation.\n\nCleaning the data often includes:\n\nfeature selection - A feature is a characteristic which tells us something about each observation. Features can be categorical or numerical. If we had a dataset of cars, a categorical feature may be the car type (i.e. sedan, coupe, 5-door), a numerical feature would might be fuel efficiency (i.e. mpg). Features are usually represented as columns in our dataset but many times the raw dataset does not give us the features we need. In some cases, we will want to remove un-useful data, or we may need to create new columns by combining or transforming existing columns.\n\nmissing data - Many times, data sets come with data that is missing, which raises questions about how we handle these observations. There are a number of approaches we could take, we could: ignore the entire observation maintain the observation, but simply ignore the missing value we could impute a value on missing values\n\nIf we were to impute value, we would have to choose what value or values to use: perhaps the mean of the known values, or median, or maybe some generated random number?\n\nIn this section, we’re going to discuss how to create features and impute values on missing data.\n\nTo demonstrate some of the code, we’ll use a air quality dataset. You can get a little background on this dataset at http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/airquality.html."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["library(datasets)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["aq <- airquality\nstr(aq)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Remove day column"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["aq$Day <- NULL\nstr(aq)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**In R, categorical data is often represented as factors. If your familiar with the java language, you can think of factors as being similar to enum types - a datatype where we list the values a variable might have.
